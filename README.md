# About
We're trialling a journal club for post-graduate students in the STAG group at the University of Southampton. The idea of the journal club is to introduce students to topics in theoretical physics that they wouldn't necessarily encounter in their own research. The material will be covered in a series of 8-10 pedagogical talks per term in a friendly environment. Ideally, we'd discuss one topic in depth per term.

Many interesting topics in theoretical physics rely on a number of concepts and ideas that aren't usually covered in a masters degree. For this reason we'll reserve term 1 for more foundational topics before moving on to slightly more advanced topics as the academic year goes on.
